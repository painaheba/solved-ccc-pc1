Assume that the PC1 is communicating with the web server. Which of the following statements are incorrect regarding the above scenario (Choose two)

<table width="665">

 <tbody>

  <tr>

   <td></td>

   <td></td>

   <td>Every packet sent by the PC1 to the web server uses 80 as a destination port number.</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td></td>

   <td></td>

   <td>Every packet sent by the web server to the PC1 uses 893 as a destination port number.</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td></td>

   <td></td>

   <td>Every packet sent by the web server to the PC1 uses 192.10.1.2 has a destination IP address.</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td></td>

   <td></td>

   <td>PC1 may send a UDP packet from time to time.</td>

  </tr>

 </tbody>

</table>

[True/False] Consider the above diagram. Note that this is a continuation of the previous problem. The TCP headers of the packets sent by the PC1 and web server are never examined by the Router 1 and Router 2. Hint: A router is a layer 3 device.
